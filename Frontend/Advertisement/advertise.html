    <h1>Advertisement Policy</h1>

    <p>
      At <strong>Health Sewa</strong>, we believe in transparency when it comes to advertising on our platform. This Advertisement Policy outlines how we manage, display, and approve ads.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Ad Relevance</h2>
    <p>
      We only display ads that are relevant to our users and align with our health-first mission. Advertisements promoting harmful, misleading, or unrelated content will not be permitted.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      Health Sewa may feature third-party ads that are clearly marked as "Sponsored" or "Ad". These third-party advertisers may collect data as per their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Endorsement</h2>
    <p>
      Displayed ads do not mean we endorse the products or services advertised. We advise users to exercise discretion before making decisions based on ads.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Ethical Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      Ads that are discriminatory, explicit, exploitative, or violate any law will not be approved or shown on our platform.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>
      Users may opt-out of personalized ads through their browser settings. However, non-personalized ads may still appear.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Reporting Concerns</h2>
    <p>
      If you see an ad that violates this policy or seems suspicious, please report it to us at: <strong>ads@healthsewa.in</strong>
